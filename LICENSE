### Acknowledgments:
This project incorporates ideas and methodologies inspired by the following works:

- **SymbolicGPT (Valipour et al., 2021)**: The dataset and methods from SymbolicGPT are used to evaluate symbolic regression techniques with diffusion models.
- **DiffusionLM (Li et al., 2022)**: Inspired by DiffusionLM, this work adapts discrete denoising models for symbolic regression tasks.
